# Database Concepts: A Technical Deep Dive

This paper provides a detailed exploration of fundamental database concepts with examples and explanations. Understanding these principles is crucial for designing efficient, reliable, and scalable database systems.

## 1. ACID Properties

**Definition:**  
ACID stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**. These properties ensure reliable transaction processing in databases.

- **Atomicity:** A transaction is all-or-nothing.  
- **Consistency:** A transaction moves the database from one valid state to another.  
- **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions execute independently without interfering.  
- **Durability:** Once committed, a transaction is permanent, even after a crash.

**Example:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

**Explanation:**  
If any part of this transaction fails, atomicity ensures that changes are rolled back. Consistency ensures balances remain valid, isolation prevents race conditions, and durability guarantees that the transfer persists after commit.

## 2. CAP Theorem

**Definition:**  
The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can provide only **two** out of the following three guarantees:

- **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the latest write.  
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a non-error response.  
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to function despite network failures.

**Example (MongoDB):**
- MongoDB prioritizes Availability + Partition tolerance (AP) but may sacrifice strict Consistency.

**Explanation:**  
Design choices depend on system requirements. Banking systems prefer **CP** (consistency + partition tolerance), while social networks prefer **AP**.

## 3. Joins

**Definition:**  
Joins combine data from multiple tables based on relationships.

**Types:**  
- INNER JOIN  
- LEFT JOIN  
- RIGHT JOIN  
- FULL OUTER JOIN  

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

**Explanation:**  
This query retrieves employee names along with their department names by matching `dept_id` with `id`.

---

## 4. Aggregations and Filters

**Definition:**  
Aggregation functions summarize data (e.g., `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`), while filters (`WHERE`, `HAVING`) restrict result sets.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

**Explanation:**  
This query finds departments with more than 5 employees earning above 50,000, showing total employees and average salary.

## 5. Normalization

**Definition:**  
Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.

**Forms:**  
- 1NF: Eliminate repeating groups.  
- 2NF: Eliminate partial dependencies.  
- 3NF: Eliminate transitive dependencies.  

**Example:**

**Unnormalized table:**

| StudentID | Name   | Course1 | Course2 |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1         | Alice  | DBMS    | OS      |

**Normalized (1NF/2NF):**

**Students Table:**  
| StudentID | Name   |
|-----------|--------|
| 1         | Alice  |

**Courses Table:**  
| CourseID | CourseName |
|----------|------------|
| 101      | DBMS       |

**Enrollment Table:**  
| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 1         | 101      |

**Explanation:**  
Normalization ensures flexibility, reduces redundancy, and improves scalability.

## 6. Indexes

**Definition:**  
Indexes speed up data retrieval by creating data structures (e.g., B-Trees, Hashes).

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
```

**Explanation:**  
This index improves lookup performance for queries filtering by `name`. However, indexes may slow down inserts/updates due to maintenance overhead.

---

## 7. Transactions

**Definition:**  
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit.

**Example:**

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 1001;
INSERT INTO sales (product_id, quantity) VALUES (1001, 1);
COMMIT;
```

**Explanation:**  
The stock reduction and sales entry must succeed together; otherwise, the database could become inconsistent.

---

## 8. Locking Mechanism

**Definition:**  
Locks control concurrent access to data.

- **Shared Lock (S):** Multiple reads allowed.  
- **Exclusive Lock (X):** Only one transaction can write.  

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
```

**Explanation:**  
This places an exclusive lock on the row until the transaction completes, preventing other transactions from modifying it simultaneously.

---

## 9. Database Isolation Levels

**Definition:**  
Isolation levels control visibility of changes between concurrent transactions.

- **Read Uncommitted**: Allows dirty reads.  
- **Read Committed**: Prevents dirty reads.  
- **Repeatable Read**: Prevents non-repeatable reads.  
- **Serializable**: Highest isolation; transactions execute sequentially.

**Example:**

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN;
-- Transaction code
COMMIT;
```

**Explanation:**  
Serializable isolation guarantees correctness but may reduce concurrency.

---

## 10. Triggers

**Definition:**  
Triggers are automated procedures executed when events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occur.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.last_modified = NOW();
```

**Explanation:**  
This trigger automatically updates the `last_modified` column whenever an employee record is updated.
